Whereas VR places a user inside a completely computer-generated environment, AR goes beyond this scope by bridging the gap between the virtual and real world seamlessly. This course will introduce theories and applications related to augmented reality technology. Students will also learn basic skills to develop augmented reality applications and content.",
